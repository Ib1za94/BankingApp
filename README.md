# Banking App Mock (Jetpack Compose)

This is a pet project showcasing a modern banking app UI built with Jetpack Compose and mock data.  
It demonstrates clean architecture, reusable components, and Material Design 3 principles — with a focus on UI, not backend.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some features are static or partially implemented. This is a UI prototype and not intended for production use.

## 💡 About the Project

The goal of this project was to demonstrate my skills in modern Android development.  
I focused on creating a clean and modular architecture while designing a visually appealing interface using only mock data.

Key areas of focus:
- Jetpack Compose + Material 3 UI
- MVVM architecture
- Reusable components and modular structure
- Navigation between screens
- Clean, scalable, and readable code
