# Banking App Mock (Jetpack Compose)

This is a UI prototype of a banking application built with Jetpack Compose.  
The app demonstrates a modern Android architecture using mock data and focuses on clean UI design, design patterns, and code structure.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a UI prototype built with mock data. Some features are static or partially implemented. The app focuses on architecture and design patterns rather than backend integration or production readiness.

## 💡 About the Project

This project was created as a pet project to demonstrate modern Android development using Jetpack Compose and clean architecture principles. The main focus was on building a visually appealing and well-structured banking app UI using mock data.

I aimed to showcase my skills in:
- Building Compose UI with Material Design 3
- Creating a modular structure using MVVM
- Designing reusable components
- Navigating between screens with Navigation Component
- Maintaining clean, readable, and scalable code
